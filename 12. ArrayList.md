# ArrayList

Recall (Chapter 8. Array)[<08. Array.md>] where we introduced the idea of array, which had the massive downside of being limited in size, well someday someone on the Java Development Team decided that that was really stupid and made this thing called an ArrayList.

Unlike Arrays, ArrayLists require Objects, you cannot use primitive types in ArrayList however their are alternatives options see the list below.

| Primitive | Object    |
|-----------|-----------|
| int       | Integer   |
| double    | Double    |
| float     | Float     |
| char      | Character |
| boolean   | Boolean   |

Basically you spell out the actual word just with a capital letter.

## Creating an ArrayList

Technically an ArrayList is an object and has to be created in a similar way.

```Java
public class Exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    }
}
```

Note the '<' and '>' characters , this is used to designate type of the array list that is being made.

In the next few functions we'll go over how to store, access and manipulate objects in an ArrayList

## .add()

Adding will add something to the end of the array for instance if we wanted to add the numbers 0 through 4 we could do the following

```Java
public class Exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            intList.add(i)
        }
    }
}
```

## .get()

Like arrays, array lists are 0 - indexed, to get a certain aspect you use `.get()` and pass it the location that you want to display


```Java
public class Exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            intList.add(i)
        }

        System.out.println(intList.get(0));
    }
}
```

## .size()

Much like array's having the options a `.length`, array lists receives something called `.size()`, because the value can fluctuate depending on how much stuff you.


```Java
public class Exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            intList.add(i)
        }

        System.out.println(intList.get(0));

        for(int i = 0; i < intList.size(); i++){
            System.out.println(intList.get(i));
        }
    }
}
```

## .set()

To override a value you need to reset it.

```Java
public class Exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            intList.add(i)
        }

        // the list is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

        System.out.println(intList.get(0));

        for(int i = 0; i < intList.size(); i++){
            intList.set(i, (5 - i));
        }

        // the list is now 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    }
}
```
