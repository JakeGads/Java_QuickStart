# Arrays

## What is an array

in short an array is a collection of same-type data contained in a singular variable, that is a set size

The way that I was taught to think about an array is that it is a hallway that contains 1 - many doors and behind those doors their are values. 

For this lesson we will take an example looking at `int` arrays but we can also make arrays out of any datatype.

## In Practice

```Java
int[] myArray = new int[5];
```
