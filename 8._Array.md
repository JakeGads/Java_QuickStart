# Arrays

## What is an array

in short an array is a collection of same-type data contained in a singular variable, that is a set size

The way that I was taught to think about an array is that it is a hallway that contains 1 - many doors and behind those doors their are values. 

For this lesson we will take an example looking at `int` arrays but we can also make arrays out of any datatype.

## In Practice

```Java
int[] myArray = new int[5];
```
this makes an array of size 5, we can acess and store information like this

```Java
myArray[0] = 1;
myArray[1] = 2;
myArray[2] = 3;
myArray[3] = 4;
myArray[4] = 5;
```
Take note that arrays are 0 index which means what you think is the first location is held at 0 instead of 1

We can use arrays to store data, however they have limits to how much data can be held, people struggled with this for longer than I have been alive and then they created the ArrayList (to be shown at a later date)

its often that you will use whats in an array in a `for` loop to do some math here is an example of getting what is in an array in a `for` loop.

``` Java
for(int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){
    System.out.println(i + ": " + myArray[i]);
}
```

An array is what is called a generic and Java does have some built in functionality to handle generics a little easy, this is an example of a for each loop doing the same thing that we are doing above

```
for (int i: myArray){
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
It simply stores the information that was in the array into a temporary variable and lets you do what ever you have to do in a separated for loop.
