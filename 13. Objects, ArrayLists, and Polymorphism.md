# 13. Objects, ArrayLists, and Polymorphism

In the last section we covered array lists in context to primitive data types, this section will cover in reference to Objects.

Please read Chapters 10 - 12 before reading this one.

## Making an array list

For starters we will be working with the `Dog` class from the [Chapter 11](<11. Object Inheritance.md>)

```Java
public class ArrayListTester{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
        
    }
}
```

## Adding to the Array List

```Java
    public class ArrayListTester{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
        dogs.add(new Dog("k9", "Ollie"));
        dogs.add(new Dog("Canis lupus familiaris", "Steph"));        
    }
}
```

Now we have 2 dogs added to the ArrayList, note we just instantiated them by using the `new` keyword


## Manipulating Elements

Because these are objects we can get use our built in functions to edit. `"Ollie"` received a improper species name so lets edit that.

```Java
public class ArrayListTester{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
        dogs.add(new Dog("k9", "Ollie"));
        dogs.add(new Dog("Canis lupus familiaris", "Steph"));

        dogs.get(0).setSpecies("Canis lupus familiaris");        
    }
}
```

## Using Methods

In the same way we can access certain functionality that was built into the objects.

```Java
public class ArrayListTester{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
        dogs.add(new Dog("k9", "Ollie"));
        dogs.add(new Dog("Canis lupus familiaris", "Steph"));

        dogs.get(0).Noise();        
    }
}
```

## Polymorphism

first off polymorphism literally means multiple forms, its the idea that a `child` of a class can also be seen as a member of the initial class if needs be for instance this will also work. Thus this is possible

```Java
public class ArrayListTester{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
        dogs.add(new Lab("k9", "Ollie"));
        dogs.add(new Chihuahua("Canis lupus familiaris", "Steph"));

        dogs.get(0).Noise();        
    }
}
```
