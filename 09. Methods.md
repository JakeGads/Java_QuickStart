# Methods (also know as functions)

A method is a way to separate code into more meaningful code blocks. It can be extremely useful if you need to reuse certain blocks of code over and over again, or if you want to make the code more readable. 

You've actually already seen a methods before but we haven't really talked about making them.
Every project will have one method which will serve as "launching point" for the rest of the code. We write this method like the following

```Java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

Up until this point we have refereed to this as the "main". In 2. Basic Structure we went over what all the words that make up this statement do, in this point we will expand on what we have already gone over

## public

`public` is what we call an access specifier, if it is set to public that means that the rest of the project will be able to find and execute this method.

the other access specifiers are `private`, `package`, `default`:

- `private` means that only the class in which the method is in will have access to it
- `package` means that it will be available to the code that is within the folder but once you leave that folder it will no longer be accessible
- `default` is never recommend in the case of robots and should generally be avoided

## static

static marks when the function is generated during the runtime of the code. If a method is marked as static it will be created even if the class in which it exists is never called. If you want to make something not `static` you simply just don't include the key word.

## void

void is what is the return type, basically anything that you can make a variable can also become a return type. you can do `int`, `double`, `string`, etc.

if you use any return type besides `void` you must include a `return` statement matching the type, that is being returned. Once a return statement has been reached then the function will exit.

```Java
public static boolean is2GreaterThan3(){
   if(2 > 3){
       return true;
   }
   elif(2 == 3){
       return false;
   }
   return false;
}
```

Note how all possible paths of logic would eventually resort, in something being returned.

## main

This is simply the name of the functions, really you can call a function anything you want as long as you don't use any of the following keywords:
|DO|NOT|USE|THE|FOLLOWING|
|-------------------|---------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| abstract | continue | for     | new        | switch    | while        |
| assert            | default | goto       | package   | synchronized |
| boolean           | do      | if         | private   | this         |
| break             | double  | implements | protected | throw        |
| byte              | else    | import     | public    | throws       |
| case              | enum    | instanceof | return    | transient    |
| catch             | extends | int        | short     | try          |
| char              | final   | interface  | static    | void         |
| class             | finally | long       | strictfp  | volatile     |
| const             | float   | native     | super     | main         |

Generally you want these names to be descriptive and understandable to an outsider reading your code.

The same conventions that stand for variables also stand for methods, don't start with numbers use camel casing.

## (), arguments and paramenters

For starters the differences between arguments and parameters doesn't matter either name you use in this context is completely fine

An argument is something that the function can take in to solve calculate whatever they are need to do for this we will remake the method from above.

```Java
public static boolean isGreaterThan2(int someNumber){
    if(someNumber > 2){
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

so this function takes in the information `someNumber` which is an `int`. We then take that `int` and depending on what that is we change the output of isGreaterThan2.

## Calling

so now that we know how to write a function we also need to know how to call them. To call a function we simply type its name followed by parenthesis, if the function requires arguments they are placed in within these parenthesis in the order that they are stated ie:

```Java
public class myClass{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int number = 5;

        if(isGreaterThan2(number)){
            System.out.println(number + " is greater than 2");
        }

        if(isDivisibleBy(number,2)){
            System.out.println(number + " is divisible than 2");
        }
        if(isDivisibleBy(number,3)){
            System.out.println(number + " is divisible than 3");
        }
    }

    public static boolean isGreaterThan2(int someNumber){
        if (someNumber > 2){
            return true;
        }

        return false
    }

    public static boolean isDivisibleBy(int originalNumber, int modNumber){
        return originalNumber % modNumber == 0;
    }

    public static int add(int one, int two){
        return one + two;
    }
}
```
