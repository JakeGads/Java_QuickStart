# Objects

An object is like a blueprint of a thing (some books will tell you that they are blueprints of nouns) for this example I will be using the a person (generally objects are always refereed to in singular form). This class will sit in the file `People.java`

```Java
public class Person{
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender; // we'll come back to this later
}
```

you may be sitting there and going "hey that kinda looks like how we made the basic structure way back when in [2._BasicStructure](2._BasicStructure.md)." However we should not the small difference of lack of a main method/function

by using private for each of these variables (called member variables) we are ensuring security ... I'm gonna level with ya, I don't know what this means  but it's common practice so thats what we go over here.

Because each variable is private we can add mutaters and accessors to them to make it easier
