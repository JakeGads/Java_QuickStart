# This will get you ready to write code for the robot

## Get the [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html)
- note this requires a free oracle account
- this may be the wrong jdk versions but we'll burn that bridge when we get there
## Get [Eclipse 20.06](https://www.eclipse.org/)
- if you are on MacOS Catalina (newest as of 6/10/2020) you may encounter some issues with setup
- if you are on MacOS (any versions) you cannot run the code on the robot (unless you run through bootcamp which is hella out of scope for this conversation)
