# This is under the hood information
## you don't need to know it but we are gonna go over it one more time

### JDK

- Stands for the Java Developer Kit
- allows you to write java code and than can compile and run said code
- We really have to focus on 2 parts

#### JVM

- Stands for Java Virtual Machine
- Takes the code (or commands you wrote) and makes it readable by other machines
- creates .class files

##### .CLASS files

- as a real quick side note, you are never able to read .class files, don't even bother to look at them

#### JRE

- Stands for Java Runtime Environment
- Executes the code (specifically the .class files)
- allows you to interact ie (provided data input, give it a data file, etc)

## Errors (as a side note)

### Syntax Errors

This means that you did something against Java's code convention and it is really upset about that. The code never compiled which means that it is being caught at the JVM and the code is never actually run.

### Runtime Errors

this means that your logic is faulty. Java is ok with the code that you wrote, you may have asked the user to enter a number but that stupid dumb idiot gave you the sentence "Jake is one cool cat" instead.
