# Math

more specifically doing math on variables for this we will be working with the following variables.

```Java
int myInt = 2;
float myFloat = 3.5;
String myString = "Jake ";
```
Before diving deeper we will go over some of basic arithmetic rules in Java.

To add we can do the following

```Java
myInt + 2; // just adds it
myInt = myInt + 2; // this will store that calculation in mInt
myInt += 2; // same as above, just in the short form
```

## Integer Math

```Java
// Reminder
int myInt = 2;
```

An integer can be added (or subsequently subtracted) by any other integer, multiplication by any other integer is also valid hence all of the below are acceptable regardless of circumstance (except for teh integer bound limit ([refer 4.Math.md](4.Math.md)))  

```Java
myInt + 2; // addition
myInt - 2; // subtraction
myInt * 2; // multiplication
```
where things can get a little weird is when we start dividing. Recall that integers can only be represented with whole numbers hence in reality 5 divide by 2 is 2 and half, however becuase of integer division it will "truncate" or remove the decimal and only return 2;

```Java
myInt / 2; // would be valid 2 / 2 = 1, 1 is a whole number and hence not an issue

myInt / 3; // would result in a fraction and hence be invalid
```

To fix this error we need to 'cast' or change the data type of one of the int. it looks like the following.

```Java
myInt / (double) 3
```

This means that the 3 will now be represented as a double and Java will take care of the rest.

when mutliply or divigning an integer with a floating point number the casting is already taken into consideration hence the following is also correct

```Java
myInt / 3.2
myInt * 3.2
```

Luckily Integer is the longest thing to go over in these sections

## Floating Point Math

```java
// Recall
float myFloat = 3.5;
```

lucky for us there is no limit on the arithmetic that can be done to floating point numbers. Hence all of the following are valid:

``` Java
myFloat + 2;
myFloat + 2.2;
myFloat - 2;
myFloat - 2.2;
myFloat * 2;
myFloat * 2.2;
myFloat / 2;
myFloat / 2.2;
```

## Alphabetic Mathematics

## Char

you can technically do math on characters, I don't recommend it because then we have to start talking about ascii values and that is extremely out of scope for this lesson 

## Strings

Strings can be combined using something that we call concatenation like this

``` Java
"Jake" + " " + "is a " + "cool" + " " + "cat";
```

## Side Note

You can also do integer modulus math with the % symbol, it doesn't often refer back to robotics so its just getting mentioned here.

## Math library

So remember in the last section when talked about the libraries well their is a library for Math stuff.

It's called Math. To use it at the top of the file just include
```Java
import Math
```
at the top of the file and you will have access to the contents of the library. BTW by going to the [JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) you can read everything that the math function can do/
