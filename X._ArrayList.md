# ArrayList

In computing a List is just an Array that has an infinite size. An ArrayList is the way that Java and Java like languages go about making a infinite sized array. Note that even in an array list you must use same typed data

the ArrayList is a higher level object which just means that it has a lot of those `.`s that we saw when talking about libraries.

to add elements to an array list we do the following
```Java
ArrayList<int> myArrayList = new ArrayList<int>();
```
