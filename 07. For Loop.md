# For Loops

## If you haven't read [6. While Loops](6._WhileLoops.md) I'd recommend doing that now

A for loop is a while loop with extra steps ... let show you an example and then explain:

```Java
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i += 1){
    System.out.println("current Index is " + i);
}
```

this snippet of code will run a total of 10 times, each time updating the value of i during the print out that text

We will now break down the first line there into each part, each aspect (seperated by a ";") is an independent aspect.

## int i = 0;

Recall back to [3. Data Types](03. Data Types.md) where we talked about making variables, that is all that is happening during this step, a variable is made and it will serve as a counter.

Now you may be asking yourself "Why do you use `i` as a counter?", no one has the answer for that question, thats just the way that it's been done for a very long time, you could also replace `i` with any other name.

## i < 10;

Recall back to [5. If Else & Boolean](<5. If Else & Boolean.md>) in which we covered what a boolean was, the same thing is happening here

NOTE generally this will include the variable that you set up in the last part but that is not a required part

## i += 1

In this step we update the varible for use throughout the loop 

Note we can also update the variable by doint `i++` which means increase the value in `i` by 1

## So the steps are:

- Initilize a variable
- Create a boolean expression
- Do some math to the intial variable
