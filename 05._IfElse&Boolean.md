# Boolean Logic

Way back when some guy named Boolean made up a system of logically determining things with numbers. With the invention of the modern day computer it became useful. Some of this may look familiar either from early education Math or at some point in advanced algebra

using boolean logic we can find if numbers are greater than (>) less than (<) or equal to (==) any other number. To denote less/greater than equal to we use <= and >=. Hence the following:

```Java
2 > 3 // 2 is greater than 3 is false hence false
3 > 2 // true
2 == 2 // true
2 >= 2 // true
```

## Compound Boolean Logic

We can use `&&` to check if both the left and the right operations are true. `||` can check if either statement is true hence the following statement

```Java
3 > 2 && 5 < 2 // because 5 is not greater than 2 this is false
3 > 2 || 5 < 2 // because one statement can evaluate to true the entire statement is true
```

## The `if` statement

Recall that `boolean` can either be `true` or `false` we can than use logic when talking about `if` statements. an `if` statement looks to a boolean adjacent to it and will only execute the following code block if that `boolean` is true.

```Java
if(2 > 2){
    System.out.println("2 is in fact greater than 2");
}

if(3>2){
    System.out.println("Hold up a second the above statments didn't write")
}
```

So the first statement is not true hence that statement will never get printed

## The `if else` statement

any `if` can be caught be an `else` and will only run if the if evaluates to `false`

```Java
if(2>3){
    // never evaluates
}
else{
    System.out.println("Welcome to the else bby")
}
```

## `if else if block`

multiple `if`s can be chained and only the one that evaluates to true will be executed

```Java
if(s < 3){
    //stuff
}
else if (s == 3){
    // different stuff
}
else{
    // final stuff
}
```

## `switch` case

a switch works similar to an `if - else if - else` block, while only comparing directly equal to format. the following is an example all statements need to end with a `break;` or they will continue to "bleed" into each other
``` Java
int s = 5;
switch(s){
    case 1: System.out.println("s is one"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("s is two"); break;
    case 3: System.out.println("s is three"); break;
    case 4: System.out.println("s is four"); break;
    case 5: System.out.println("s is five"); break;
    default: System.out.println("s is not between one and five"); break;
}
```
