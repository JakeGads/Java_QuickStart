# Object Inheritance

Please if you do not know what an object is or any of the aspects of objects refer to [Chapter 10. Objects](<10. Objects.md>)

## Definition

So objects can have this thing called a chain of inheritance, the best way to describe this is with a practical example. We will once again be using the `Person` Example from [Chapter 10](<10. Objects.md>). So I can use the `Person` class to describe myself but there are a lot of other nouns that I can describe myself as, I'm a `Student`, `Software Engineer`, and a `Tutor`. All three of those things can also be called a `Person` so in an effort to save time and lines of code Java has a system to set say a `Software Engineer` as a `Person`.

The chain of inheritance is critical to Java, the entire language is built upon it, every class that is made is given the default inheritance of `Object` which in itself has a few properties, `uuid`, `toString()`, `memory locations` ... and you will need none of it, like ever. This means that every chain starts at `Object`.

We call things that are higher in the chain of inheritance `parents` and things that are lower `children` 

## Example

We are gonna to make a class called `Animal`, that means that right now our chain of inheritance looks like this:

`Object` -> `Animal`

`Animal` is a `child` of `Object`

`Object` is a `parent` of `Animal`

```Java
public class Animal{
    private String species;

    public Animal(string species){
        this.species = species;
    }

    public setSpecies(String species){
        this.species = species;        
    }

    public getSpecies(String species){
        return this.species;        
    }
}
```

This animal class is very bare-bone so lets expand upon that using inheritance, I really like dogs so thats what we will do first. 

`Object` -> `Animal` -> `Dog`

```Java
public class Dog extends Animal{
    private String name;

    public Dog(String species, String name){ // NOTE: 1
        super(species);
        this.name = name;
    }

    /* Pretend there are getters and setters for "name" here */

    public String Info(){
        return this.getSpecies() + ": " + this.name; // NOTE: 2
    }

    public String Noise(){
        return "Bark";
    }
}
```

Note 1: the `super` call this means that it actually reaches up to its `parent` so it can call on that constructor

Note 2: we never defined `getSpecies` for a `Dog` but because it inherits from `Animal` it can access it 

## Overriding

So we can keep going deeper, We will make 2 objects that inherit from `Dog`, `Lab` (large Dog) and `Chihuahua` (small dog)

hence our new inheritance chain looks like: (I apologize for the formatting but it really hates multiline)
```
                                    Lab
                                /
Object    ->  Animal    ->  Dog
                                \
                                    Chihuahua
```

So `Labs` and `Chihuahua` are just dogs only difference is how loud they bark

```Java
public class Lab extends Dog{
    Dog(String species, String name){
        super(species, name) // so this calls Dog(species, name)
    }

    @Override
    public String Noise(){
        return "!!!BARK!!!";
    }
}
```

```Java
public class Chihuahua extends Dog{
    Dog(String species, String name){
        super(species, name) // so this calls Dog(species, name)
    }

    @Override
    public String Noise(){
        return "__ bork __";
    }
}
```

Any time you re-define a method within a class you must include an override clause.
