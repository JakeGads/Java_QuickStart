# Objects / Classes

We've seen classes before but we haven't written a "proper class" yet. 

A class is a description of some noun, or a blueprint if you prefer that analogy. I see it as a way of creating your own structures of data, for public class (class that are available outside of their current file it must match the name of the file)
