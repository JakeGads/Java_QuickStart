# Objects / Classes

We've seen classes before but we haven't written a "proper class" yet. 

A class is a description of some noun, or a blueprint if you prefer that analogy. I see it as a way of creating your own structures of data, for public class (class that are available outside of their current file it must match the name of the file).Generally classes are described as singular nouns. In this example we will be creating a class step by step, with the entire thing collected at the bottom of this file.

## Making a Class

for this example we will be working on a class called `Person`, a `Person` will consist of a `String` to represent the name and an `int` to represent the age.

so on the first line our class will look like

```Java
public class Person{

}
```

because this class is public it must exist in a file called `Person.java`.

In our `main` we can use the class with the following syntax

## Instantiating Classes for use

```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
    Person jake = new Person();
    Person phil = new Person();
}
```

hence we have created 2 distinct objects of person. As we continue we will keep manipulating `jake` and `phil`.

## Class Member Variables

Class can have member variables, these exist in one instance of the class, and are unique to each instance hence if I can make Jake's name "jake" and Phil's name "phil" and `Java` will be remember each name for each specific `Person`. Member variables are generally given the private scope for security reasons. On most occasions you will not give defaulted values to the members

```Java
public class Person{
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

We can also make static members that are available even if the class is not created.

```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

Static variables are usually given a starting value and receive the `public` access specifier.

Because static variables are public they can be accessed the following way:

```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println(Person.species)
    Person jake = new Person();
    Person phil = new Person();
}
```


## `this`

we should also take some time to mention what `this` is. `this` refers to the current object that you are in. It can serve as a way of naming things without having to worry about overrides. Throughout the rest of the examples `this` will be used in its proper context, If you plan on writing software 


## Accessor / Getters

Because of all those pesky private variables we need to make functions that allow us to to find the data that stored in the class, this is called accessors and are done with public function.


```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName(){
        return this.Name;
    }
    
    public int getAge(){
        return this.age;
    }
}
```

## Mutators / Setters

Again those pesky privates means that we must we must make this functionality in a method.

```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(string name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

with this we can set the values in the `main` like this:

```Java
public class exe{
    public static void main(String args){
        Person jake = new Person();
        jake.setAge(21);
        jake.setName("Jake Gadaleta")
    }
}
```

## Accessors / Getters

In the same way that we use functions to edit the values in the class we also use functions to get the information retrieve information that is held by the class. We write the accessors like the this:

```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(string name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }

    public string getName(){
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getAge(){
        return this.age;
    }
}
```

## Constructors

Constructors allow you to assign values to an object when it is created. by default you are given an empty constructor that does nothing to the object, thats what we have been using up until this point. It should also be stated that an object can have multiple constructors, as long as their arguments are different.

We make constructors by making a `public` function with the same name as the class and with no return type.

```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(string name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }

    public string getName(){
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getAge(){
        return this.age;
    }

    // this requires no arguments
    public Person(){
        this.name = "John Smith";
        this.age = 0;
    }

    // this takes in parameters
    public Person(String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

So to use these constructors in `main` we can do the following.

```Java
public class exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Person john = new Person(); // using the empty constructor
        Person ryan = new Person("Ryan", 18);
    } 
}
```

## Methods 

Finally methods are incudes in classes, they are the verb, or what the class can do. for instance a person can say his/her name. Writing a method in a class is the same as writing it in the executable file.

```Java
public class Person{
    public static String species = "homosapien"
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(string name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }

    public string getName(){
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getAge(){
        return this.age;
    }

    // this requires no arguments
    public Person(){
        this.name = "John Smith";
        this.age = 0;
    }

    // this takes in parameters
    public Person(String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void speak(){
        System.out.println("Hi my name is " + this.name);
    }
}
```

To call a method its simply 

```Java
public class exe{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Person ryan = new Person("Ryan", 18);
        ryan.speak();
    } 
}
```

Note the `.` which is the same as when we do `System.out.println`
