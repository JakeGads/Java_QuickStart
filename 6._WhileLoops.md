# While Loop

Sometimes we will want code to continually run until some condition is met.

Lets consider the following situation. You want to minapulate the robot to move back and forth until an IR sensor tells you that you are in a safe location to try to score some points.

```Java
// assume IR is some floating point number that is read from a literal IR sensor

// assume that minDistance is some floating point number that is the minum number that can be expected from the sensor


// assume that maxDistance is some floating point number which is the maxium number that can be expected from the sensor

// English:
    // while IR is greater than the absoulute max distance and
    //      IR is less than the minumim distance
    // this sets it up as a range
while(IR > maxDistance && IR < minDistance){
    if(IR > maxDistance){
        // here goes some code that makes the robot back up
    }
    else if(IR > minDistance){
        // here goes some code that makes the robot move forward
    }
    IR = updateIR();
}
// here goes some code that tells the robot what to do next
```

basically you can use a while loop to repidly try to set itself up until the starter boolean statment becomes false.

A while loop will always check at the begining, if you want to run through an iteration prior to the check you can use a do while loop it looks like this

```Java
do{
    if(IR > maxDistance){
        // here goes some code that makes the robot back up
    }
    else if(IR > minDistance){
        // here goes some code that makes the robot move forward
    }
    IR = updateIR();
}while(IR > maxDistance && IR < minDistance);
```

Both of these are equally preformate there is really no correct way.
